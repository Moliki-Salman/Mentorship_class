/* In Java  quotation  mark “ ” is needed to write a string e,g var myLastName = “Moliki”. 
However if you have many quotation mark in a string eg “my name is” Damilola Moliki” Salman”;
it is important to add the back slash mark \ before each string so that Java can interpret it 
properly as one single string like this:  
var myStr =   “my name is \” Damilola Moliki \” Salman”; */
