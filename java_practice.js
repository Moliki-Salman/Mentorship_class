/* three ways to declare a variable in  Java*/
// var var is used through out the program. Var can be changes 
var myName = "Damilola";
//let: let is only used with in the scope of where you declare them
let  ourName = "Meenadcode";
//const: const is a variable that should never change 
const n = 2.5;
var a = 10
console.log(a);
var sum = 10 + 3;
console.log(sum);
//incrementing number: this is when you add 1 to a number
var myVar = 45
myVar = myVar + 1;

/* a = a + 12; is d same as using the += operator: a+= 12;
b = 9 + b; is d same as using the += operator: b+= 9;
c = c + 7;  is d same as using the += operator: c+= 7;
the above example is both adding and assigning  value to the variable 
NOTE: this short cut is also applicable to *= and /= */


/* In Java  quotation  mark “ ” is needed to write a string e,g var myLastName = “Moliki”. 
However if you have many quotation mark in a string eg “my name is” Damilola Moliki” Salman”;
it is important to add the back slash mark \ before each string so that JS can interpret it 
properly as one single string like this:  
var myStr =   “my name is \” Damilola Moliki \” Salman”;
